# Payment Integration using CashFree Gateway

Payment Integration using CashFree Gateway.

## Note
Payment using UPI is working and will show SUCCESS or FAILED or CANCELLED STATUS once you proceed.
Payment using Web need some params like APP_ID, TOKEN_DATA, ORDER_ID, for working. But still if you click on DO WEB PAYMENT,
it will open CashFree Payment Gateway Page in app itself but will show error that APP_ID invalid.
